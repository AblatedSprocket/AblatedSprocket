# My Github!

Iâ€™m interested in free and open source software and figuring out how I can contribute in some meaningful way. I program in C#/.NET professionally, but use Emacs a lot at home, and use it to try to make myself more productive and program Rust.

My Github account gets less love than my Gitlab account, so if you're intrested in what I'm working on, I suggest looking there instead.

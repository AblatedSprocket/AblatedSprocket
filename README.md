# My Github!

Iâ€™m interested in free and open source software and figuring out how I can contribute in some meaningful way. I program in C#/.NET professionally, but use Emacs and Elisp a lot at home. My preferred language is Rust, but I haven't programmed anything particularly useful, it's much easier to just hack Emacs to get things done.

My Github account is really only used for IndieAuth at this point, if you're intrested in what I'm working on, I suggest looking at Codeberg instead: https://codeberg.org/ablatedsprocket
